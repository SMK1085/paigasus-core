# actionlint gate over .github/workflows/** (SMA-525).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A `paths:` filter that comes to match nothing does not error — the workflow
# simply stops running, forever, with no red check and no notification. prebuild.yml triggers
# only on push-to-main/workflow_dispatch plus a narrow pull_request filter, so its 7-platform
# verification would silently cease. Nothing in this repo linted workflow YAML before this.
#
# actionlint alone is NOT sufficient: it validates syntax and has no view of the file tree, so
# a syntactically valid glob that matches nothing (`rz/**`) passes it cleanly. Checks 5-7 below
# are what actually close the failure this gate was filed for.
#
# EXIT CODES (ci/ convention): 1 = assertion failure, 2 = infrastructure error. Without the
# split, a broken tool reads as a lint failure — or, if anyone wraps this in `|| true`, as a pass.
#
# NOT `set -e`: check 3 deliberately EXPECTS non-zero exits, and grep-based extraction
# legitimately finds nothing. Each check captures status explicitly and sets FAILED instead.

# reasons: a `*.yml` argument list would silently miss a `.yaml`-suffixed workflow, and

# rather than a vacuous pass) applies ONLY to the auto-discovery path — an explicit glob that

# VERIFIED. And the stdin fixtures of checks 3/4 are NOT suppressed by that config even when
# -stdin-filename names a matching path (also verified), so the self-tests cannot detect it.
# An explicit assertion is the only thing that can.
#
# The file itself is permitted: `self-hosted-runner.labels` is the documented escape hatch for a
# new GitHub runner label the pinned binary does not know (spec §6). Only `ignore:` is banned.

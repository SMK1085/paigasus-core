# affected-graph regression guard (SMA-409 / SMA-429)

`moon ci` *uses* the affected graph but never *asserts* it is correct: a deleted
`dependsOn` edge — or a dropped `moon ci --include-relations` — makes the affected set
silently shrink, so CI under-builds and stays **green**. This guard closes that gap.

`run.sh` feeds a synthetic touched-file to `moon query projects --affected --downstream
deep` and asserts the affected project set **equals** an exact expected set per known case
(default-deny; `repo`, which owns the whole tree as its source, is filtered out):

- **contracts edit** → `contracts` + `paigasus-proto-{rs,py,ts}` + `paigasus-gateway-rs`.
- **kernel edit** → `paigasus-kernel-rs` + `paigasus-py-bindings-rs` + `paigasus-node-bindings-rs`
  + `paigasus-wasm-rs` + `paigasus-gateway-rs` + `paigasus-kernel-py` + `paigasus-kernel-ts` (both
  language wrappers wrap their bindings, SMA-419/420/427). Strict equality rejects any other project
  implicitly.
- **py binding edit** → `paigasus-py-bindings-rs` + `paigasus-kernel-py`; one-directional w.r.t.
  the kernel.
- **node binding edit** → `paigasus-node-bindings-rs` + `paigasus-kernel-ts`; one-directional
  w.r.t. the kernel.
- **wasm binding edit** → `paigasus-wasm-rs` + `paigasus-kernel-ts`; one-directional w.r.t. the
  kernel. `paigasus-kernel-ts` now has two upstream binding edges — `paigasus-kernel-rs →
  paigasus-node-bindings-rs → paigasus-kernel-ts` (napi) and `paigasus-kernel-rs →
  paigasus-wasm-rs → paigasus-kernel-ts` (wasm, SMA-427) — so a kernel edit reaches it via both.

It also asserts every `moon ci` invocation in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` carries
`--include-relations` (the edges are inert without it).

Run locally: `moon run repo:affected-smoke` (or `ci/affected-graph/run.sh`).
Prove it can fail: `ci/affected-graph/run.sh --negative-control`.

## Maintenance — expected sets are exact (default-deny, SMA-429)

Each case asserts the affected set (minus `repo`) **equals** its expected set exactly — there is
no separate must-exclude list and no forbid enumeration. Cross-stack isolation is enforced
implicitly: any project that appears but isn't in the expected set fails the case.

- A project **unrelated** to a case never enters its downstream set, so it never appears → no
  maintenance (this is what the old hand-maintained forbid-regex existed to track).
- A project that **legitimately** becomes a new dependent (e.g. a future wasm kernel binding)
  makes the case fail with an `unexpected` entry → confirm the new edge is intended, then add the
  one project to that case's expected set.

The expected sets are a snapshot of `moon query --affected --downstream deep` output at the
**pinned moon version** (currently 2.3.2). A moon upgrade that changes the affected-set output —
even benignly — will fail the guard, so re-grounding the expected sets is a known step of any
moon bump.
